William S. Burroughs’ attacks language with experimental narrative tactics in “Johnny 23”, published in 1973 in the short story collection *Exterminator!*. The string of words that is this short story form a stream of consciousness, which challenged me to rethink the very experience of reading. The story itself tells of a doctor who is “disturbed” by other people and decides to spread a “beautiful disease” that will make “the world a fit place for him to live.”
